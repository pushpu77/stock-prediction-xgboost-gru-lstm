# Stock Prediction of Closing Prices using LSTM, GRU+LSTM, XGBoost in Real Time

Predicting stock market trends is one of the most challenging problems due to the numerous patterns in stock price trends throughout the day. Every variation from the normal trend can indicate something new, as the stock market is constantly evolving. This necessitates continuous study of new problems and patterns that emerge in stock trends.

# Methodology
To address this challenge, I utilized deep learning technologies, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks, to capture long-term features and seasonal effects that are crucial for understanding complex trends in stock prices.

# Results
LSTM and GRU Performance:

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 2.43
Variance Regression Score: 0.93
R² Score: 0.93
Boosting Methods (XGBoost):

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 3.69
Upon comparison, LSTM and GRU techniques provided better metrics than boosting methods.

# Risk Analysis and EDA
In addition to model development, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and descriptive statistics on stock price trends to capture the correlation between different stocks and assess the risk associated with each stock. All the graphs and inferences are included along with the code for better understanding.

Conclusion
The deep learning techniques, particularly the combination of LSTM and GRU, showed superior performance in predicting stock prices, as evidenced by the lower RMSE and higher variance regression and R² scores compared to boosting methods like XGBoost. The EDA provided valuable insights into stock correlations and risk assessments, enhancing the overall understanding of stock market trends.
